You can run wii-monitor without install by just running the script:

./scripts/wii-monitor

install copies the script to /usr/local/bin/wii-monitor, installs some icons for notifications and
copies wiimote mappings to ~/.cwiid/

If you didn't run install you  eed to:

mkdir ~/.cwiid/
cp cwiid/* ~/.cwiid/ -r

After install you can run wii-monitor at startup on Ubuntu Unity desktop:

cp cwiid_monitor.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

You can set the install prefix to other than `/usr/local` with:

python setup.py install --prefix=/usr
