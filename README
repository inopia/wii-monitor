`wii-monitor` is a python script that monitors running processes and runs 
`wminput` with game specific configuration and displays a desktop notification
if you start one of the supported games. `wminput` works by mapping wiimote
and nunchuk to keyboard and mouse actions.

Adding new games
----------------

You can view the key configurations at ~/.cwiid/wminput/ and create your own.
You also need to add process name to wmminput configuration mapping to 
~/.cwiid/game_mappings.json

Please commit your new mappings. You can also gift me steam games and I may
add mappings for them. My steam nick is inoppi.

Usage
-----

Just run the scrip `wii-monitor`. You need to press 1+2 on your wiimote to 
connect. Each time you start a game wiimote will disconnect and you need to 
re-press 1+2. When the wiimote is connecting you can see the battery status
from the blinking leds (4 == full, 1 == 25% or less).
Led 1 will stay lit while wiimote is connected.
